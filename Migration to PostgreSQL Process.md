## PostgreSQL Migration Process

The first step in the migration process is to gather and analyze the following information: 

| Step | Description | Overview |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1 | Number of SQL Server Instances to be migrated | Assess the scale of migration by counting the SQL Server instances. |
| 2 | Total number of Databases across all instances | Determine the number of databases involved in the migration. |
| 3 | Total size of data to be migrated | Evaluate the data volume including table count, row count, and total size. |
| 4 | Number of objects to be moved | Count all database objects like tables, views, stored procedures, and jobs. |
| 5 | Capabilities and shortcomings comparison | Analyze strengths and weaknesses of both the source and target platforms. |
| 6 | Workarounds for unsupported features | Identify and plan for features not supported by the target platform. |
| 7 | Application code migration | Plan for migrating application code that interacts with the database. |
| 8 | Jobs, Queries, and Reports migration | Migrate database jobs, queries, and reporting processes. |
| 9 | Data warehousing / OLAP migration | Address the migration of data warehousing and Online Analytical Processing components. |
| 10 | Post migration performance comparison | Compare the performance before and after migration and plan for enhancements. |
| 11 | Post migration monitoring and support | Set up ongoing monitoring and support for the new environment. |

## pgloader

`pgloader` is an open-source data loading tool specifically designed for PostgreSQL, which allows for the efficient and fast migration of data from various sources into a PostgreSQL database. It is particularly known for its ability to simplify the process of migrating databases from other database systems (like MySQL, SQLite, MS SQL Server, and others) to PostgreSQL.

Key features and characteristics of `pgloader` include:

1. **Multiple Data Sources**: It can load data from various sources including MySQL, SQLite, MS SQL Server, CSV files, and more.
2. **Efficiency**: `pgloader` is designed to be fast and efficient, capable of loading large volumes of data quickly.
3. **Data Transformation**: During the migration process, `pgloader` can transform data formats (like date formats) and schema structures to match the PostgreSQL requirements. This includes converting table definitions, indexes, foreign keys, and more.
4. **Error Handling**: It can handle and log errors without stopping the entire migration process, making it easier to troubleshoot and fix issues.
5. **Customization**: Users can write custom scripts to specify how data should be transformed or loaded, offering flexibility for complex migrations.
6. **Command-Line Tool**: `pgloader` is a command-line utility, making it suitable for automation and use in scripts.

`pgloader` is particularly popular in scenarios where a database is being moved from a different DBMS to PostgreSQL, due to its ability to manage differences in data types, schema definitions, and other database-specific characteristics.

## Babelfish Compass

Babelfish Compass is a standalone tool designed to assist in migrating SQL Server-based applications to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition using Babelfish. Here's a detailed overview of the tool and its functionalities:

1. **Compatibility Assessment**: Babelfish Compass evaluates the compatibility of SQL Server applications with Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL. This includes analyzing DDL (Data Definition Language) and SQL code and thoroughly reviewing how well an existing SQL Server application will function when migrated to Babelfish.

2. **Detailed Reporting**: The tool provides a comprehensive report listing all supported and unsupported features within the SQL Server application's code. This report is crucial for understanding the changes that may be needed for successful migration.

3. **Platform Availability**: Babelfish Compass is versatile in terms of platform compatibility, as it can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their operating system.

4. **First Step in Migration**: Using Babelfish Compass is recommended as the initial step in the process of migrating SQL Server applications to Babelfish. Analyzing the DDL and T-SQL code helps determine the extent to which the code will be supported by Babelfish and identifies areas that may require modification.

5. **Facilitating Smooth Migration**: The tool plays a key role in easing the transition from SQL Server to PostgreSQL. It helps users identify potential issues in advance, streamlining the migration process and reducing the chances of encountering unexpected problems during the migration.

In summary, Babelfish Compass is an essential tool for anyone looking to migrate their SQL Server applications to Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL. Its ability to analyze and report on compatibility issues makes it an invaluable resource in the planning and execution of such migrations.
