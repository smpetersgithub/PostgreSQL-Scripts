This file created at 09-Jan-2024 06:35:44 for report C:\Users\smpet\Documents\BabelfishCompass\Myreport\report-Myreport-bbf.3.4.0-2024-Jan-09-06.35.44.csv and Babelfish v.3.4.0 by Babelfish Compass version 2023-12

This .csv file is intended for import into a spreadsheet.
It is aimed at assisting specialist Babelfish Compass users in quantifying the amount of work required
to address non-supported items in a Babelfish migration -- based on the user's own estimates and experience.
The column for 'Complexity' (below) indicates an expected low/medium/high complexity for the item in question as defined
by Compass but this can be overridden with user-specified values in config file C:\Users\smpet\Documents\BabelfishCompass\BabelfishCompassUser.cfg.
The user should add their own formulas to the spreadsheet for performing calculations for example in the column marked 'Your-Calculation-Here'.

Status: Not Supported

,SET options
,,SET DATEFORMAT mdy,1,Currently SET DATEFORMAT is not supported; Babelfish effectively uses the 'mdy' setting. Use escape hatch \\"sp_babelfish_configure 'escape_hatch_session_settings' 'ignore' [ 'server']\\" to suppress the resulting error message.,MEDIUM,,0,,0,

Status: Review Semantics

,DDL
,,ALTER TABLE..CHECK CONSTRAINT,8,Enabling FK or CHECK constraints is not currently supported; constraints are always enabled; use escape hatch \\"sp_babelfish_configure 'escape_hatch_nocheck%' 'ignore' [ 'server']\\" to ignore and proceed.,MEDIUM,,0,,0,
,,ALTER TABLE..NOCHECK CONSTRAINT,8,Disabling FK or CHECK constraints is not currently supported; constraints are always enabled; use escape hatch \\"sp_babelfish_configure 'escape_hatch_nocheck%' 'ignore' [ 'server']\\" to ignore the error message and proceed.,MEDIUM,,0,,0,
,,Constraint PRIMARY KEY/UNIQUE CLUSTERED in CREATE TABLE : created as NONCLUSTERED no physical row order in PG,8,CLUSTERED constraints are not currently supported. The constraint will be created as if NONCLUSTERED was specified. Review all (implicit) assumptions about row ordering or performance due to existence of a CLUSTERED index.,MEDIUM,,0,,0,

,Views
,,View without SCHEMABINDING: created in PG as WITH SCHEMABINDING,16,PostgreSQL only supports views with the equivalent of WITH SCHEMABINDING i.e. a table cannot be dropped if a view depends on it. A view without the SCHEMABINDING clause will still be created by Babelfish but as if WITH SCHEMABINDING was specified.,LOW,,0,,0,
